# AdventOfCode 2024

This is my (hopeful) solutions to the Advent Of Code 2024.

## Disclaimers

My philosophy for this event is to solve with a medium level approach, work with files and stl.

This project is done in cplusplus 2020, so use a compiler that is compatible with this version.

All code was made with `clang++`, if you do not have clang installed, you are free to change it to `gcc`.

## Running

All the commands to run this project are done in a Makefile tasks:

### Run a specific day:
```
$ make day<number>
```

This command runs the problem specified for that day, with two algarisms and zero indexed based (sorry pascal guys).

### Clean all executables:
```
# make clean
```

This task will just remove all binary files associated with the project.
